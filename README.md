# Sound JavaScript and TypeScript samples

The web is full of bad JavaScript. This repo is an attempt to only post good JavaScript/TypeScript.

This repo was set up using create-react-app's TypeScript template so we can focus on writing code and tests and leave the test runners and webpackin' to someone else.
